'''
    Mnemonic:   os_digger
    Abstract:   Makes what ever openstack API calls are needed to complete the 
                command line request.  This isn't really indended for direct user
                use, but as a support tool for tegu_req.

    Requires:   At least: python3, nova client (python-novaclient), these may require
                additional things (with python it's bloody hard to tell).

        Builds a map with keys that are mac addresses, ipaddresses and
        (maybe) VM names, all translating to the endpoint (port) uuid.
        Also builds maps for vmname to all endpoints and endpoints to 
        all assigned ip addresses.

        Using a limiting vm name significatnly speeds this up as only 
        one interface list call is needed. If a limit is not provided
        the map will be for the entire project, and requires an interface
        info gathering api request for each VM.

  Basic syntax is:
    os_digger [-v] command [parms]

  Supported commands are:
    [-a] epid id [id2...idn]  
        Translate id to an endpoint uuid id may be mac address, ip address or vm name.
        in the case of vm name the result may not be consistant or correct if the vm has multiple
        interfaces unless the -a option is used. When -a is supplied the output is a set of 
        tuples (epid, mac, ipaddress) for each interface that the VM has. If -v is set, then the 
        output is prefixed with the id used on the command line, and an output record for each
        id on the command line is generated.  In all cases, each ID's information is written
        on a separate line.
