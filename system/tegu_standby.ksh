#	Mnemonic:	tegu_standby
#	Abstract:	Simple script to either turn on or turn off standby mode. We do this by creating/removing
#				a file in the TEGU_ETCD directory (/etc/tegu by default).
#				The first parameter must be on, or off to affect change. The parameter state will write
#				the current state to the tty and exit. Any other invocation will restult in a usage
#				message.  The command must be executed as the tegu user or it will error. When turning off
#				stand-by mode, an attempt will be made to restore the most recent checkpoint files from
#				the synchronisation archive. This can be disabled by adding a second parameter: norestore.
#
#	Date:		25 July 2014
#	Author:		E. Scott Daniels
#
#	Mod:		27 Aug 2014 - Added protection against chef running 'service tegu standby' if the node
#					has been put into active mode.
#				10 Mar 2015 - Made less chatty since it gets invoked every n seconds by tegu_ha and
#					thus pollutes the log.
