	Author:		E. Scott Daniels

	Mods:		
				26 May 2015 - Changes to support pledge as an interface.

/*
	For a single bandwidth pledge, this function sets things up and sends needed requests to the fq-manger to 
	create any necessary flow-mods.   This has changed drastically now that we expect one agent 
	onvocation to set up all bandwidth flow-mods for an endpoint switch.

	With the new method of managing queues per reservation on ingress/egress hosts, we now send 
	the following information to fq_mgr:
		h1, h2 -- hosts
		expiry
		switch/port/queue
	
	Path list will have path(s) in both directions (to support different bandwidth rates).
	The above info is sent for each 'link' in the forward direction path, and then we reverse 
	the path and send requests to fq_mgr for each 'link' in the backwards direction.  Errors are 
	returned to res_mgr via channel, but asycnh; we do not wait for responses to each message 
	generated here. 

	To_limit is a cap to the expiration time sent when creating a flow-mod.  OVS (and others we assume)
	use an unsigned int32 as a hard timeout value, and thus have an upper limit of just over 18 hours. If
	to_limit is > 0, we'll ensure that the timeout passed on the request to fq-mgr won't exceed  the limit,
 	and we assume that this function is called periodically to update long running reservations.

	Alt_table is the base alternate table set that we use for meta marking

	If pref_ip6 is true, then if a host has both v4 and v6 addresses we will use the v6 address.

	This builds a fq-mgr request and passes it to the fq-mgr to 'refine' and send along 
	to the agent-manager for ultimate execution.  It might be possible to pass it 
	directly to the agent manager, but because res-mgr thinks in IP addresses, and 
	fq-manager (that might be the only source of IP->Mac translation which flow-mods
	need) is still left in the middle. 

	CAUTION: this function is called for both new reservations, _and_ to refresh
		reservations with expiry value further in the future than the switch can
		handle.  It is also invoked when pausing reservations and will cause new
		flow-mods to be sent with a short duration timeout to flush existing flow-mods
		from the switch.
