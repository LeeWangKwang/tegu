#	Mnemonic:	ql_fiilter_rtr
#	Abstract:	Run various ip commands to get a list of router/gw mac addresses that are currently
# 				active on the node.  Using the list, and the output from ovs_sp2uuid (stdin) 
#				generate an augmented set of ovs_sp2uuid output.  The filter applied allows all 
#				non-router elements to pass, and blocks router elements if there is no corresponding 
#				mac address listed by the series of ip commands.
#
# 				Running through the name spaces seems to be expensive, based on a trial on a loaded L3,
#				so we'll cache the list and regenerate it only if we think it is out of date.
