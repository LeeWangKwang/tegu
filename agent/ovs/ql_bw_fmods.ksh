#	Mnemonic:	ql_bw_fmods
#	Abstract:	Generates a series of flow-mods for a bandwidth reervation.
#				These flow-mods assume rate limiting is done via the br-rl veth
#				connection to br-int and that br-int is the target OVS bridge for
#				the flow-mods. All flow-mods for a reservation are built (both inbound
#				and outbound). Because we assume the OVS is a learning switch, all
#				inbound traffic for a VM that is pushed over br-rl, must be directly
#				output to the VM (avoid normal) because as traffic leaves we _do_
#				use the normal processing so that openstack flow-mods are touched
#				and this has the effect of making the VM appear to live on the other
#				side of br-rl which it does not.
#
#				Fmods are set up this way:
#					inbound
#						p500 in from br-rl && dest == reservation VM			must match before outbound 450
#							 [strip-vlan], [strip dscp], output to VM port 
#						p430 dest == reservation VM && src == reservation VM	must match after outbound 450
#							 set queue, output to br-rl
#						p425 dest == reservation VM
#							 output br-rl
#
#					outbound
#						p450 in from br-rl
#							 set meta, resub for openstack rules
#						p400 meta == 0 && src == reservation VM && dest == reservation VM
#							 [set vlan], set dscp, set queue, output br-rl
#						p300 meta == 0 && src == reservatio VM
#							 [set vlan], output br-rl
#
#					When both VMs are on the same switch, the outbound p400 rule can be 
#					omitted because it's the same as the p450 rule. When a specific protocl
#					is also being matched, then the outbound p400 fmod will have a slightly
#					higher priority (405) to avoid conflict should there be a more generic
#					reservation with the same pair (concern is when the endpoint is the router
#					rather than another VM).
#
#				The 425 and 300 f-mods are generic and as such there will be only one even if there
#				are multiple reservations involving the same endpoint.  Because of this, we need to 
#				create a 425 or 300 f-mod ONLY if the expiry time will be extended.
