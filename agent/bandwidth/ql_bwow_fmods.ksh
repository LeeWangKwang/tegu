#	Mnemonic:	ql_bwow_fmods
#	Abstract:	Generates all needed flow-mods on an OVS for a oneway bandwidth reservation.
#				One way reservations mark and potentially rate limit traffic on the ingress
#				OVS only.  There is no attempt to set any flow-mods for inbound traffic as
#				we do NOT expect that the traffic has been marked by us on the way "in".
#				A oneway reservation is generally implemented when the other endpint is
#				external (cross project, or on the other side of the NAT box), and the router
#				is not a neutron router (i.e. not under OVS).
#
#				Bandwidth reservation flow mods are set up this way:
#					inbound (none)
#
#					outbound
#						p400 Match:
#								meta == 0 &&
#								reservation VM0 &&
#								external-IP [&& proto:port]
#							 Action:
#								mark with meta value (-M)
#								set dscp value
#								resub 0 to apply openstack fmods
#
#				We no longer need to set VLAN on outbound nor do we need to strip VLAN on inbound, so
#				vlan options are currently ignored (supported to be compatible with old/unchanged
#				agents).  Same with queues. We aren't queuing at the moment so the queue options are
#				ignored. In future, there will (should) be a concept of flow-limits (meters maybe)
#				which will be passed in as queue numbers, so the -q option needs to be kept and should
#				be expected and used when the underlying network compoents can support it.
