#	Mnemonic:	ql_bw_fmods
#	Abstract:	Generates all needed flow-mods on an OVS for a bandwidth reservation
#				between src and dest VMs (-s and -d respectively). Src is considered
#				to be the local VM (the VM that is attached to the OVS, and dest is
#				the remote VM (-l and -r could be used, but src and dest are used in
#				the other agent scripts so this is being consistent).  In the case where
#				one of the VMs is a router, and an external IP address is supplied and
#				must be used as the flow-mod match criteria, an indication is needed
#				as to whether the the external IP address is "associated" with the
#				source or destination VM.  This is indicated by the presence of the -S
#				or -D option on the command line.
#
#				Bandwidth reservation flow mods are set up this way:
#					inbound
#						p450 Match:	
#								meta == 0 &&
#								vlan id &&
#								reservation VM0 &&
#								reservation VM1 [&& external IP]
#							 Action:
#								[strip dscp value]
#								set metadata 0x01 (resub 90)
#								resub 0 for openstack fmod application
#
#					outbound
#						p400 Match:
#								meta == 0 &&
#								inbound openflow port &&
#								reservation VM0 &&
#								reservation VM1 [&& external IP]
#							 Action:
#								mark with meta value (resub 90)
#								set dscp value
#								resub 0 to apply openstack fmods
#
#				In the brave new world of endpoints (using uuids rather than mac addresses from Tegu),
#				and to deal with the fact that openstack happily allows duplicate MAC addresses, we need
#				to do the following:
#					1) using the local (source) uuid, suss out the vlan id and the openflow port number
#					   from ovs. 
#					2) match outbound traffic based on the inbound openflow port/mac combo since that
#					   is unique where MAC might not be.
#					3) match inbound traffic based on the mac/vlan combination as that is unique
#					   where mac alone is not.
#
#				Transport protocol (tcp/udp) and ports are pesky things. The reservation may have one
#				associated with either endpoint.  The invocation of this script uses -p and -P to 
#				associate a protocol and port port number with the remote endpoint (-r) and the local
#				endpoint (-s).  For the local endpoint -P is used and -p is used if there is a proto/port
#				associated with the remote endpoint.

#	Date:		20 March 2015
# 	Author: 	E. Scott Daniels
#
#	Mods:		22 Mar 2015 - Added keep on exit option.
#				27 Mar 2015 - Added ipv6 support.
#				20 Apr 2015 - Accept external IP direction
#				11 May 2015 - Inbound flow-mods must match all types, changed to allow for this.
#				14 May 2015 - To eliminate the use of br-rl and thus the last HTB queue. (flow-mods are
#								now very simple, one in each direction)
#				28 May 2015 - Added match vlan support (-V)
#				18 Jun 2015 - Better handling of -q allowing HTB shutoff to be affected completely by
#								agent scripts (Tegu still thinks it's being set!)
#				09 Oct 2015 - Added ability to xlate a neutron uuid into a mac/vlan/ofport tuple.
#				16 Oct 2015 - Tweaked protocol args on the send_ovs_fmod commands.
#				20 Oct 2015 - Correct bug that was not marking the protocol correctly (was putting on all src
#								or all dest on both inbound and outbound fmods rather than src for one and
#								dest for the other.
#				13 Nov 2015 - Now susses the bridge based on uuid from ovs rather than assuming br-int.
#				14 Jan 2016 - Fixed typos in comments/doc.
#				16 Jan 2016 - Added ability to set rate limiting flow-mods (yet again) if the bridge is
#								listed in the config file on the bandwidth:rate-limit variable.
#				18 Jan 2016 - Added ability to detect and properly handle a source TCP address (e.g.
#								token/project/endpoint/123.45.67.89[:port][{vlan}] can be supplied on the 
#								reservation to Tegu which yields -P {tcp|udp}[:address]:{port|0}. 
#								Deprecated running on remote host with -h option.
