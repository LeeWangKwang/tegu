#	Mnemonic:	ql_setup_ipt
#	Abstract:	Delete and then install the iptables rules in mangle that do the right thing for our DSCP marked traffic
#				This must also handle all of the routers that are created in namespaces, so we first generate a
#				set of commands for the main iptables, then generate the same set for each nameespace. This script is 
#				broken from a larger script which (before ssh_broker) used ssh to execute the commands generated. The
#				structure of generating a single command file, and then executing has been maintained, but the script
#				doesn't support executing the commands on a remote host.  As a result of breaking this out, the script
#				does support a delete option (-D) which will delete all of the iptables rules in the mangle table that
#				we have added. 
#
#				We have discovered that setting up iptabes across a large (+2000) set of name spaces can take a noticable
#				amount of time, and there are indications that this setup might impact current flows.  This observation
#				has been made by seeing increased numbers of retransmissions from some applications during the execution,
#				but has not directly been tied to these activities.  To this end, the script will only add the iptables
#				rules if it appears that the rules are not missing.  We assume that listing the iptables in each name
#				space, while taking time, will not have any impact on exising flows.

# known possible values: x2e, x1a, x12 and the default 00; we should be smart enough to 
# only validate what was asked for by tegu based on the tegu config.
