#	Mnemonic:	ql_set_trunks
#	Abstract:	Read the output from ovs_sp2uuid and suss off all VLAN IDs for br-int. Then
#				generate a trunk command that adds the trunk list to the qosirl0 interface.
#				Trunks must be set on the interface in order to set the vlan-id in a flow-mod
#				as data passes to the interface. Trunks canNOT be set as a range.
#
#				As of OVS 2.1 it seems that the listing of VLAN IDs on a trunk port isn't
#				needed, so this script may now be deprecated.
#
#				To delete all VLAN IDs from the trunk list:
#					ovs-vsctl remove port 94da17a2-5042-476a-8a49-1e112e273c14 trunks 2,3,7,8,9,17,4095
