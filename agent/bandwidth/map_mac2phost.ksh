#	Mnemonic:	map_gw2phost
#	Abstract:	This script accepts a list of hosts and generates a mac to host for
#				switches and ports.
#				
#	Author:		E. Scott Daniels
#	Date: 		04 May 2014
#
#	Mods:		11 Aug 2014 - Corrected usage message.
#				14 Oct 2014 - Corrected over stepping after the vlan tag was added to ovs_sp2uuid output
#				09 Dec 2014 - Corrected bug when sussing out port information.
#				09 Jan 2015 - Filter off records that don't have a mac address (-1$)
#				29 Jan 2015 - Added prefix option to allow this to be executed on a local host
#					where the operational name of the host doesn't match hostname (e.g. in the DPA1
#					environment hostname returns o11r6 but the operational name is o11r6-ops.
#				24 Apr 2015 - Doesn't use the grep return value as the final return value to prevent
#					a bad return code if the resulting output is empty (normal if no VMs are on the host).

	  match the operational name forcing the use of localhost.
