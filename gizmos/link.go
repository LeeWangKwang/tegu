	Mnemonic:	link
	Abstract:	Manages a link in the network. 
				A link is unidirectional representing data flow between two switches from the 
				backward switch to the forward switch.  For each link an obligation is used
				to manage the usage that has been pledged for the link at various points in 
				times.  For a path between two switches that is bi-directional, there will be 
				two links which likley share a common obligation. Having a link manage only 
				unidirectional traffic makes queue setting for priorities on the last link
				in a path easier, and also makes path finding simpler.
			
				sw1 ------link------ sw2
	   			backward             forward
			
				Potential comfusing naming, but it is logical....
				The set_forward_queue() function will set the queue on _sw1_ NOT on the forward
				swtich!!  The logic is that the port/queue on sw1 is the port/queue where 
				data is pushed to go to the forward switch.  Similarly, set_backward_queue()
				will set the proper port/queue on sw2 -- where to put data in the backward
				direction. 
			
				Initially the link maintained only 'forward' information, there was no 
				concept of the backward switch, but the need to manage queues for individual
				reservations introduced the need, and while confusing the struct was extended
				using the related term.
