	Mnemonic:	obligation
	Abstract:	This is an object that tracks the obligation of something over time.
				An obligation has an overal commence and conclude time (UNIX
				timestamps) and a maximum capacity. The obligation is subdivided
				into time windows between the commence and conclude times with
				each time winodw tracking an obligated capacity. By default, the
				obligation spans from the epoch until well into the future (2025ish);
				there is probably no reason for a user application to change this.

				The obligation now supports the concept of queues associated with
				each timeslice.  This allows the user to further subdivide a slice
				of time based on the 'consumer' of that segment of the slice. Queues
				are actually managed by the time_slice object, but must be recognised
				here so that they can be 'passed through' etc. The use of queues are
				optional; a user programm may need only to treat the obligation as a
				whole value for each timeslice and thus can use the original inc/dec
				functions to manage.  When using queues, the inc/dec functions should
				not be used.

				The obligation 'exposes' queues to a caller using a queue ID (name)
				and reserves a special name, "priority," to generically refer to
				a reserved queue used for priority traffic.  While it shouldn't be
				necessary to know, the priority queue will always map to queue 1 and
				any other named queue will map to 2 through qmax.

	Date:		22 November 2013
	Author:		E. Scott Daniels

	Mods:		11 Feb 2014 : Added support for queues and removed the direct references
					to timeslice fields.
				12 Jun 2014 : Added abilty to alarm if a link reaches a threshold percentage
					of the total link capacity.
				29 Jun 2014 : Changes to support user link limits.
				29 Jul 2014 : Mlag support
				18 Jun 2015 : Corrected cause of potential core dump if queue ID passed in is
					empty. Some cleanup of commented lines.
				22 Jun 2015 : Corrected cause of core dump when updating utilisation on mlag.
