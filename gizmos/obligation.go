	Mnemonic:	obligation
	Abstract:	This is an object that tracks the obligation of something over time.
				An obligation has an overal commence and conclude time (UNIX
				timestamps) and a maximum capacity. The obligation is subdivided
				into time windows between the commence and conclude times with
				each time winodw tracking an obligated capacity. By default, the 
				obligation spans from the epoch until well into the future (2025ish);
				there is probably no reason for a user application to change this.

				The obligation now supports the concept of queues associated with 
				each timeslice.  This allows the user to further subdivide a slice
				of time based on the 'consumer' of that segment of the slice. Queues
				are actually managed by the time_slice object, but must be recognised
				here so that they can be 'passed through' etc. The use of queues are 
				optional; a user programm may need only to treat the obligation as a 
				whole value for each timeslice and thus can use the original inc/dec
				functions to manage.  When using queues, the inc/dec functions should
				not be used. 

				The obligation 'exposes' queues to a caller using a queue ID (name)
				and reserves a special name, "priority," to generically refer to 
				a reserved queue used for priority traffic.  While it shouldn't be 
				necessary to know, the priority queue will always map to queue 1 and
				any other named queue will map to 2 through qmax.

	Author:		E. Scott Daniels

	Mods:		11 Feb 2014 : Added support for queues and removed the direct references
					to timeslice fields.
