/*

	Mnemonic:	time_slice
	Abstract:	Represents a slice in time with for which a single value (amt)
				is known.   The amount is subdivided into queues which represent
				a fraction of the total amount that has been pledged to a particular
				host's traffic.

				The object is designed to be managed as a link list member. The 
				'owner' of the object may arrange the list as needed and methods like 
				split() will automatically insert new time_slice objects into the list 
				when needed. Similarly, Amt is exported so that the object owner may 
				easily manipulate it without a method call. 

				The timeslice may optionally be given queue information.  Adding a 
				queue to the set will increase the timeslice's amount used (amt). Removing
				a queue will decrement the amount used.  Queue numbering is tricky because
				it is desired to keep the same queue number for a port/host from the 
				start until the end of the reservation for the host which may span more 
				than one timeslice.

	Mods:		29 Jun 2014 - Changes to support user link limits.
				07 Jul 2014 - Now generates queue strings if the bandwidth amount is 
					greater than zero.
