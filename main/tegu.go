	Mnemonic:	tegu
	Abstract:	The middle layer that sits between the cQoS and the openflow controller (Skoogi)
				providing an API that allows for the establishment and removal of network
				reserviations.

				Command line flags:
					-C config	-- config file that provides openstack credentials and maybe more
					-c chkpt	-- checkpoint file, last set of reservations
					-f host:port -- floodlight (SDNC) host:port
					-p port		-- tegu listen port (4444)
					-s cookie	-- super cookie
					-v			-- verbose mode

	Mods:		20 Jan 2014 : Added support to allow a single VM in a reservation (VMname,any)
							+nnn time now supported on reservation request.
				10 Mar 2014 : Converted to per-path queue setting (ingress/egress/middle queues).
				13 Mar 2014 : Corrected 'bug' with setting pledges where both hosts connect to the 
							same switch. (bug was that it wasn't yet implemented.)
				03 Apr 2014 : Added endpoint support for reservations and flowmods.
				05 May 2014 : Changes to support merging gateways into the graph and for receiving
							responses back from the agent.
				13 May 2014 : Changes to support dscp-exit value supplied on reservation.
				16 May 2014 : Corrected bug with specifying the "exit" dscp value.
				18 May 2014 : Now supports cross tenant reservations.
				29 May 2014 : Now supports default openstack value propigation in config file.
				05 Jun 2014 : Added pause/resume ability.
				06 Jun 2014 : Added TLS/SSL support.
				09 Jun 2014 : Added token authorisation support for reservations.
				11 Jun 2014 : All paths option added-- reservation will be based on capacity over all
							paths between h1 and h2.
				16 Jun 2014 : Added abilityt to authorise privledged commands with a token generated using 
							the default (admin) user name given in the config file.
				17 Jun 2014 : Added support for transport ports on reservation host names. 
				25 Jun 2014 : Added user (project, tenant, whatever) level caps on each link (gak).
				07 Jul 2014 : Added refresh API request.
				15 Jul 2014 : Added support for parital reservation path when only one endpoint is given a
							valid token on the reservation request.
