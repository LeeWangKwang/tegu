# tegu configuration file

# ---- Default section info used by multiple subsystems ---------------------------------------------------

# 	sdn_host supplies the host:port of the openflow controller Comment it out to use the static 
#	physical graph and thus "tegu-lite".
#
#	static_phys_graph supplies the file name containing the static graph which is simulated openflow 
#		controller output (json) when not using an openflow controller (tegu-lite). Supplying both
#		sdn_host and graph file, results in the sdn being used and not the static map.
#
#	queue_type is either "endpoint" or "all". When endpoint is supplied (the default) then the queue
#		settings generated are only applied to the endpoints of the path (egress and ingress) assuming
#		that intermediat switches have generic flow-mod rules and queues for pushing prioritised traffic.
#		It also affects the flow-mods generated.  When "endpoint" is supplied, flow-mods at the ingress
#		and egress switches are all that are generated. 
#
#	log_dir sets the directory where log files are written (cycled daily); use "stderr" to write
#		log messages to standard error
#
#	pri_dscp is a space separated list of DSCP values that might be set by applications that are running
#		on VMs that have reservations.  These values are preserved in packets as they exit the environment.
#		(It is not possible to preserve all by default as that would require 64 flow-mods per reservation
#		on both the ingress and egress switches.)

# ----- network manager settings 	------------------------------------------------------------------------
#	refresh is the delay between refreshes of the network topology either from the static file or from the 
#		SDN controller (floodlight).
#
#  link_headroom indicated the percentage of headroom that each link is to be given; reservations may use up
#		up to the link capacity less this percentage. 
#
#  link alarm is the percentage of a link's capacity that once reserved for a given time period will cause
#		an alarm. 
#  all_paths causes all paths to be discovered and verified between the two hosts on a reesrvation request
#       rather than finding just the shortest path between the two hosts.
#
#  usr_link_cap is the percentage of link capacity that any single user will be allowed to reserve. This
#		limit can be increased on a per user basis by sending a setulcap request via the API.  If the value
#		given here is set to 100, then no limits for any users are set, EXCEPT if an api call is made
#		to set a limit on a specific user.

# Describes parameters which are used only by the http interface. The http manager will enable SSL/TLS mode
# (https:// secure interface) when the key and cert pahtnames are given; otherwise (when missing, empty strings
# or commented out) secure interface is disabled and communcations will be via http://.
#
# cert and key are filenames that contain the certificate and private key. If the same file contains both,

# openstack interface specific parameters
# ostack_list is a comma (or space) sep list of section names  that appear later in the config file, or project 
#		(tenant) names; the list may contain a mixture. When a project name is given, it is assumed to use the 
#		default values for usr, password and url that are given in the main section. If a section name is given 
#		the values for usr, password and url will override the default values if supplied. The project name
#		must always be supplied in the section if a section is used.  If 'all' is supplied, Tegu will dig out 
#		a list of all tenants that are known to the default user and use those. The list will be refreshed
#		on a periodic basis, so adding a new tenant when 'all' is used will automatically be noticed. 
#
# 		Openstack credentials are supplied to Tegu using the default usr, passwd, and url values
#		or the values supplied in an overriding section. 
# 		openstack credentials that is used to gather information about the VMs and physical hosts.
#
# include_tenant is a boolean which when true causes Tegu to use tenant-ID/vmname and 
#		tenant-ID/IP-address combinations rather than using names and addresses alone.
#		default is false.
#
# require_token causes tegu to require that host names on a reservation request be of the form token/tenantid/hostname
#		and will confirm that the supplied token is valid for the tenant.  The tenant ID may be a project name.
