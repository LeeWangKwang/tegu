Description: Provides Tegu and applications needed to implement QoS-Lite
  Tegu is a daemon which provides 
  an API that allows external users 
  (programmes) to request bandwidth 
  reservations in the cloud environment 
  that is known to Tegu. For each approved 
  reservation Tegu causes OVS queues to be 
  set on physical hosts in the cloud, and 
  to have flow-mods bangged in that allow 
  the network traffic related to the 
  reservation to be prioritised.
