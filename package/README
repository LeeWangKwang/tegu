This directory contains files and scripts that are used to package QoS-Lite into 
a .deb (and maybe other) package formats. 

The script export.ksh creates an export directory in /tmp/<username>/export/<version>
and builds a tar file that is placed into /tmp/<username>/export/bundle that then
is used to bundle the release.  The package name (e.g. qlite) and version number
must be supplied as positional parms on the command line.  Files are extracted
from various parts of this repo directory structure, so ensure that you have the 
correct branch checked out AND that it is up to date!!

The script bundle.ksh assumes that the export.ksh script has been executed and 
that the tar file for the bundle exists in /tmp.  It builds the .deb.  This is a 
two step process to allow other bundle scripts to be used against the same 
tar file, etc.
