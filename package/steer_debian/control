Description: Provides Tegu for Q-Lite, flow steering, port mirroring 
  Tegu is a daemon which provides 
  an API that allows external users 
  (programmes) to request bandwidth 
  reservations in the cloud environment 
  that is known to Tegu. For each approved 
  reservation Tegu causes OVS queues to be 
  set on physical hosts in the cloud, and 
  to have flow-mods bangged in that allow 
  the network traffic related to the 
  reservation to be prioritised. Flow 
  steering and port mirroring reservations
  are also supported by this release of 
  the code.
